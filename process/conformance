Zowe Conformance

Zowe is an integrated and extensible framework designed to allow users the flexibility to choose how they 
interact with z/OS. In order to better serve this goal, the Zowe community is developing a Conformance Program. 
The Zowe Conformance Program gives users the confindence that when they use a conformant product or app, they can rely
on a high level of common functionality and interoperability. Conformance provides Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), System
Integrators (SIs) and end users confidence that their software will behave as expected.
Just like Zowe, the Conformance program will continue to evolve and is managed by contributors in our community. The program
is divided into two parts: 1) Zowe Conformant Applications and 2) Zowe Conformant Distribution.
