# Considerations for Coding contributions to Zowe

When contributing source code to Zowe there are two primary requirements.  

First, all repositories need to contain a license file.  Zowe uses the [Eclipse Public License 2.0](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v20.html).  Include the this file in the Zowe repostiory.

Second, all source files need to include a header to clearly show the license.
