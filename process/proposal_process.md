# Zowe Sub-project Proposal Process

Based on the [CNCF Project Proposal Process v1.1](https://github.com/CNCF/toc/blob/40abe6f81c2b46842a87d6c47cf4190f0d8c1856/process/project_proposals.adoc)

## Introduction

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for sub-projects to be accepted into Zowe. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into Zowe, and new projects to be formed within Zowe. Zowe Leadership Committee (ZLC) will review all proposals in a timely manner.

## Project Proposal Requirements

Projects must be proposed via pull request to [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/tree/master/proposals](GitHub). Project proposals submitted to Zowe must provide the following information to the best of your ability:

* Name of project (must be unique within OMP)
* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)
* Statement on alignment with OMP charter mission
* Sponsor from ZLC (sponsor helps mentor projects)
* Preferred maturity level (see https://github.com/OMP/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc[OMP Graduation Criteria])
* License and contribution guidelines (Zowe project requires code contributions to Zowe are to be made under the [Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL-2.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/EPL-2.0.html) and all non-code contributions are to be made under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC-BY-4.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html) unless otherwise approved by the Open Mainframe Project Governing Board, having each committer agree to the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/)
* Source control (GitHub by default)
* External dependencies (including licenses)
* Initial committers (how long working on project)
* Infrastructure requests (CI / Build Cluster)
* Communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)
* Issue tracker (GitHub by default)
* Website
* Release methodology and mechanics
* Social media accounts
* Community size and any existing sponsorship

## Project Acceptance Process

* Projects are required to present their proposal at a ZLC meeting
* Projects get accepted via a 2/3 supermajority vote of the ZLC
* All projects must adopt the Linux Foundation [Code of Conduct](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/code-of-conduct/).
* All projects agree to transfer any relevant trademarks to Open Mainframe Project and to assist in filing for any relevant unregistered ones. This assignment will be reversed if the project does not remain in Zowe, as described below.
* All projects start at the Incubation stage by default unless the ZLC approves otherwise.
