## Issues to be discussed on 11-14-2018

### Vote on these to move forward and close
Clarify Zowe release 1.0 date to officially be Tuesday January 22, 2019.  Reasons for the move are to allow time for better integration, improved security features, better positioning post 2018 which has low visibility due to the holidays.
Zowe 1.0 Release, Tuesday, January 22, 2019
[X] Matt Hogstrom  - Traveling - Added my +1 based on the date above, please remove if the date changes from Jan 22, 2019.
